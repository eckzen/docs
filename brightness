To fix the brightness setting not in maximum on every reboot:

Go to terminal:

	gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local

The text inside should look like this:

#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
rfkill unblock bluetooth
echo 40 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
#echo 5 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
exit 0
